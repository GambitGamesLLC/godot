# GDGS compositor staged QA — 2026-05-17

## Scope

QA pass for bead `oc-hf4` against:

- Godot repo branch: `gambit/instrumentation/2026-05-17-gdgs-compositor-breadcrumbs`
- GDGS repo branch: `gambit/instrumentation/2026-05-17-gdgs-compositor-breadcrumbs`

The goal was to run the staged compositor isolation order and identify the first stage that reproduces the Vulkan device-loss crash.

## Branch / worktree state used

- Godot repo working tree: `/home/derrick/.openclaw/workspace/projects/godot`
- GDGS repo working tree: `/home/derrick/.openclaw/workspace/projects/aerobeat/aerobeat-vendor-gdgs`
- No extra worktree was needed; both repos were already on the instrumentation branches, so QA did not disturb unrelated work.

## Runner used

Temporary QA harness artifacts were staged under:

- `/home/derrick/.openclaw/workspace/.temp/gdgs-stage-repro-2026-05-17/`

Key run directories:

- normal run: `/home/derrick/.openclaw/workspace/.temp/gdgs-stage-repro-2026-05-17/official-20260517-090004/`
- accurate-breadcrumb rerun: `/home/derrick/.openclaw/workspace/.temp/gdgs-stage-repro-2026-05-17/official-accurate-20260517-090036/`

Note: the staged QA harness exercised the GDGS instrumentation package successfully using the installed Godot binary at `/home/derrick/.local/share/openclaw/godot/current/godot`. A source build of the Godot instrumentation branch was started in parallel, but the first failing boundary was already isolated before that build completed, so the evidence package below comes from the staged GDGS branch plus the managed Godot runtime.

## Stage order requested vs. executed

Requested order:

1. callback only
2. no dispatch
3. trivial dispatch if available
4. projection only
5. radix only
6. boundaries only
7. render last
8. compositor writeback / presentation only if earlier stages stabilize

Executed:

1. `callback_only` — completed, stable
2. `prepared_no_dispatch` — completed, stable
3. trivial dispatch — **not available in the package**; no dedicated scratch/known-safe dispatch stage was exposed by the branch, so QA noted the gap and continued per instructions
4. `projection_only` — **first failing stage**, reproduced crash in both normal and `--accurate-breadcrumbs` reruns
5. `radix_only` — not run, because projection was already the first failing boundary
6. `boundaries_only` — not run, because projection was already the first failing boundary
7. `render_only` — not run, because projection was already the first failing boundary
8. full compositor writeback / presentation — not run, because projection was already the first failing boundary

## Findings

### Stable boundary before failure

`callback_only` and `prepared_no_dispatch` both survived repeatedly.

Evidence:

- `callback_only` summary: `/home/derrick/.openclaw/workspace/.temp/gdgs-stage-repro-2026-05-17/official-20260517-090004/run_summary.tsv`
- `prepared_no_dispatch` log: `/home/derrick/.openclaw/workspace/.temp/gdgs-stage-repro-2026-05-17/official-20260517-090004/logs/prepared_no_dispatch.normal.log`
- accurate rerun summary: `/home/derrick/.openclaw/workspace/.temp/gdgs-stage-repro-2026-05-17/official-accurate-20260517-090036/run_summary.tsv`

Notable seam evidence from the stable runs:

- compositor callback enters cleanly and can be repeatedly short-circuited at `callback_only`
- the current repro path still reports the corrected seam as global/global:
  - `compositor_path_uses_global_rd=true`
  - `raster_path_expected_global_rd=true`
  - `raster_path_uses_global_rd=true`
  - `local_device_submit_sync_exercised=false`
- `prepared_no_dispatch` reaches `renderer stage=prepared_no_dispatch_gate` and returns compositor textures without device loss

### First failing stage

`projection_only` is the first stage that reproduces the crash.

The crash occurs after the first meaningful compute dispatch is enabled, before radix, boundaries, render, or compositor writeback/presentation are needed.

Normal-run evidence:

- `/home/derrick/.openclaw/workspace/.temp/gdgs-stage-repro-2026-05-17/official-20260517-090004/logs/projection_only.normal.log`

Accurate-breadcrumb rerun evidence:

- `/home/derrick/.openclaw/workspace/.temp/gdgs-stage-repro-2026-05-17/official-accurate-20260517-090036/logs/projection_only.accurate.log`

Relevant chain from the accurate rerun:

1. `renderer stage=projection_begin`
2. `rd dispatch pipeline=gsplat_projection push_constant_bytes=128 direct=true group_count=(1060, 1, 1)`
3. `rd barrier complete pipeline=gsplat_projection`
4. `renderer stage=projection_end`
5. `renderer stage=projection_only_gate`
6. compositor returns through `raster_only_no_writeback_gate`
7. later `fence_wait` fails with `VK_SUCCESS` check failure
8. lost-device breadcrumbs still collapse to `BLIT_PASS`

That means the first failing boundary is now much tighter than before: the crash no longer requires radix sort, tile boundaries, the final render pass, or compositor writeback/present. Projection dispatch alone is enough.

## Interpretation

This QA pass materially reduces the suspect set.

Still supported by evidence:

- projection compute dispatch or data written by it
- synchronization / lifetime issue that becomes visible immediately after projection work is submitted
- engine/backend breadcrumb coverage still being too coarse once the device is already lost

Made less likely by this pass:

- pure compositor callback entry/exit handling
- compositor writeback / presentation path
- local RenderingDevice submit/sync seam mismatch in the current repro path
- radix / boundary / render passes as the *first* trigger

## Recommended next suspects

1. projection output buffer / image writes and bounds assumptions
2. projection pipeline layout / push constant contract (`128` bytes in the observed dispatch)
3. hazards around resources consumed after `projection_only_gate`, even though later GDGS passes are skipped
4. why device-loss breadcrumbs still flatten to `BLIT_PASS` after the fence failure, despite the tighter stage isolation
